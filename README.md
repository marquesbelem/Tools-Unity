## Unity Editor Tools

In this repository, you will be able to see some of my code created for the development of various tools using Unity Editor, for different scenarios.

### AudioControllerDebugWindow • [Code](https://github.com/marquesbelem/Tools-Unity/blob/main/AudioControllerDebugWindow.cs)
This tool was created to track events triggered through the FMOD plugin, allowing you to know the stack trace and the state of the event.

### FMODRefreshEventsWindow • [Code](https://github.com/marquesbelem/Tools-Unity/blob/main/FMODRefreshEventsWindow.cs)
This tool was created to rewrite an event path within ScriptObject-type objects.

### GetJSONFileDrawEditor • [Code](https://github.com/marquesbelem/Tools-Unity/blob/main/GetJSONFileDrawEditor.cs)
This tool was created to read information from a JSON file and populate a list to apply information all at once.

### ToolAddPrefabs • [Code](https://github.com/marquesbelem/Tools-Unity/blob/main/ToolAddPrefabs.cs)
This Unity Editor tool allows developers to easily register and categorize prefabs within the project using a custom Odin Inspector window. It saves prefab metadata (name, path, category, and biome) into a JSON file for consistent project organization and version control. Useful for managing level design assets like hazards, gameplay elements, and scenery across different game worlds.

### PrefabWindow • [Code](https://github.com/marquesbelem/Tools-Unity/blob/main/ToolAddPrefabs.cs)
A Unity Editor tool that provides a user-friendly interface to browse, filter, and spawn categorized prefabs in the scene based on category and biome data. It reads a JSON config generated by the "Add Prefabs" tool and allows designers to quickly instantiate prefabs or image references directly into the level. Ideal for streamlined level design workflows.
